Welcome to My ReactJS Calculator
Task
The task is to build a simple, interactive calculator using ReactJS. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with a user-friendly interface. The challenge lies in ensuring a smooth user experience, managing state efficiently in React, and handling operations like clearing inputs and chaining operations properly.

Description
To solve this problem, I created a React application with the following key features:
A clean and responsive UI for the calculator.
Usage of React components to break down the calculator's functionality into smaller, reusable parts.
Efficient state management with React's useState hook to track inputs and operations.
Error handling for invalid operations, such as division by zero.
CSS for styling the calculator, making it visually appealing and ensuring a great user experience.
Installation
To get the calculator up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-react-calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd my-react-calculator
Install the dependencies:

npm install
Run the application:

npm start
The app will start a development server, and you can view the calculator by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Usage
Once the app is running, you can interact with the calculator through its UI. It includes number buttons, operators, and functionalities such as:

Input numbers: Click on the numeric buttons to enter numbers.
Operations: Perform basic operations like +, -, *, and /.
Equal (=): Press this button to compute the result.
Clear (C): Press this button to reset the current calculation.
There are no command-line arguments required to run the project, as it is entirely web-based.
